    "intro": "Hello, this is the first post on this blog. I made the blog to have one central location for the puzzles I made, so I'll be uploading both old and new puzzles I deem worthy of a place on this magnificent blog. \r\nAs a first post, what could be more fit than the man, the myth the Dateable Puzzle Lol&#x2122. If you haven't solved it before, enjoy:)",
    "rules": "Draw lines connecting all clues to form a loop which travels through each clue once. Lines only travel straight from clue to clue (allowing non-orthogonal lines). Two line segments may intersect each other only at a 90&deg angle. All clues containing the same letter must be connected consecutively. Clues containing different letters may not be directly connected; the loop must travel through at least one black dot between them.",
